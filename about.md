This site is dedicated to robot programming.  There are many great resources that show you how to build physical robots and wire up the electronics.  They will often include some basic programming to get the robot moving.  These are fantastic resources for the robot enthusiast but sometimes you may want to do a little more than just get the robot to move.  This site attempts to do just that, we want to get our robots to do really cool things like autonomous navigation, object manipulation, and gesture recognition. 

<!-- We’ll create a number of projects each of which will have its own robot control challenge to solve.  Each project will come with a series of articles explaining the robot programming challenge is overcome. -->

Each program relies on the constantly evolving fields of control theory, artificial intelligence and vision processing.  Therefore, we’ll need to delve into those subjects in order to solve each programming problem.  I’ve put these subjects in their own categories with links to the relevant articles from each project. 

I’ll focus on the algorithms rather than coding for a specific controller. The site is not intended to be about programming style or efficiency.  The code examples are written as clearly as possible in order to explain the concepts of robot control.  Therefore, you will easily be able to convert the code examples into other languages such as Python or Java.
